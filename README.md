# Parallax-and-Landing-Elements

I aimed to achieve a dynamic user experience, with Parallax Scrolling and varied Floating and Landing Elements. The technologies I used for this project are as follows:

- HTML, CSS, JADE, SASS
- JavaScript(jQuery)

The Tools I Used:

- ATOM
- CodeKit
- iTerm for Git Version Control

The theme of this project was due to my love of The Pizza Show on Vice Munchies! :D
